# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.
	Traceroute is used to determine a path between one machine/ip address to another.
	A request to one ip may be routed through many machines before reaching its destination.
	Traceroute can determine intermediate machines by specifying a maximum number of machines
	a packet is allowed to visit. Once this number is reached, if the packet is not 
	at the destination then the current machine returns an error.
	Traceroute can use the ICMP and UDP protocol.
## Give the source IP address that issued the traceroute command and the destination IP address.
	source: 192.168.0.100, Destination: 74.125.225.46
